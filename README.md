# BubbleSort-Visualization

# Sorting Algorithm Visualization

This is a Python program that visualizes the bubble sort algorithm using the Tkinter library. It generates a random dataset and sorts it using the bubble sort algorithm, while visually representing the sorting process on a canvas.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ING-MARWA/BubbleSort-Visualization.git
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install tkinter
   ```

## Usage

1. Run the `Project.py` file:

   ```bash
   python Project.py
   ```

2. The program window will open, and you will see a user interface with various options.

3. Select the algorithm (currently only bubble sort is available) and the speed of the visualization.

4. Set the data size, minimum value, and maximum value for the dataset.

5. Click on the "Generate" button to generate the dataset.

6. Click on the "Start" button to start the sorting algorithm visualization.

7. The canvas will display rectangles representing the dataset elements, and their colors will change as the algorithm progresses.

8. Once the sorting is complete, the execution time will be displayed.
